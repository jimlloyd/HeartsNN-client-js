# HeartsNN-client-js
A node.js client for HeartsNN

This is a node.js test client for playing Hearts against the
[HeartsNN](https://github.com/jimlloyd/HeartsNN) server.

This is still under development, and despite the fact that
v1.0.0 has been published to npmjs.org, it can't run without
being installed locally, parallel to the HeartsNN repository,
so that the symlink `play_hearts.proto` can resolve to the
real .proto file via the relative path
`../HeartsNN/play_hearts/protos/play_hearts.proto`

More documentation to come....
